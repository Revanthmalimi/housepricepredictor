# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model built with Python and scikit-learn to predict house prices based on various features. Linear regression is used to model the relationship between the independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable (house price).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) dataset from Kaggle. It includes a wide range of features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for model building, prediction, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for easy installation.

 cd house-price-prediction

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the data, data preprocessing steps, and model building process.

Use the provided scripts in the scripts/ directory to train the model and make predictions.

Experiment with different features, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score. You can find the evaluation results in the Jupyter notebooks.

## Future Improvements
Feature engineering to create more relevant features.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Exploring more advanced regression techniques.
